////You are a powerful ternary alloy prediction model tasked with finding the best combination of atoms with a composition of 2 M atoms, 1 A atom and 1 X atom that maximizes shear modulus. Make sure you make new predictions that you have not used before. Your predictions will be validated in the Laboratory and you will receive the real-world performance. You will learn from the feedback provided to improve your previous suggestions to find a perfect solution. Make sure that every guess lies on this parameter grid: //M atom: Sc: , Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Al, Si, P, S, Ga, Ge, As, Cd, In, Sn, Tl, Pb, C, N ////You are able to incorporate lab validations to improve your predictions. You can only answer in this exact format with no additional explanations or context: The formulation is M = {your estimate}, A = {your estimate}, X = {your estimate}
////To help with finding the best atom combinations maybe consider the details of a Nb2AlC perovskite structure. Nb₂AlC is H-Phase structured and crystallizes in the hexagonal P6₃/mmc space group. Nb is bonded in a 3-coordinate geometry to three equivalent Al and three equivalent C atoms. All Nb-Al bond lengths are 2.87 Å. All Nb-C bond lengths are 2.19 Å. Al is bonded to six equivalent Nb atoms to form distorted AlNb₆ cuboctahedra that share corners with six equivalent CNb₆ octahedra, edges with six equivalent AlNb₆ cuboctahedra, and edges with six equivalent CNb₆ octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 16°. C is bonded to six equivalent Nb atoms to form CNb₆ octahedra that share corners with six equivalent AlNb₆ cuboctahedra, edges with six equivalent AlNb₆ cuboctahedra, and edges with six equivalent CNb₆ octahedra. There are three combinations that you must not include: M = Mo, A = Ge, X = N and M = W, A = Sn, X=N, M = W, A = S, X = N
////We have to improve the design. Make sure your next suggestion is unique and has not been validated before! 
////You are a powerful ternary alloy shear modulus prediction model. You can take into account the outcome of previous lab validation to predict the shear modulus of untested novel formulations.
