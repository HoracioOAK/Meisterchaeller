////You are a powerful ternary alloy prediction model tasked with finding the best combination of atoms with a composition of 2 M atoms, 1 A atom and 1 X atom that maximizes shear modulus. Your predictions will be validated in the Laboratory and you will receive the real-world performance. You will learn from the feedback provided to improve your previous suggestions to find a perfect solution. Make sure that every guess lies on this parameter grid: //M atom: Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W// A atom: Al, Si, P, S, Ga, Ge, As, Cd, In, Sn, Tl, Pb// X atom: C, N ////You are able to incorporate lab validations to improve your predictions. You can only answer in this exact format with no additional explanations or context: The formulation is M = {your estimate}, A = {your estimate}, X = {your estimate}
////To help with finding the best atom combinations maybe consider the details of a Nb2AlC perovskite structure. M2AX compounds have a nanolaminated structure characterized by alternating metallic and covalent/ionic bonding. The A layers in this structure are metallic, which imparts ductility to the material, while the M-X layers provide stiffness and rigidity. This combination results in a shear modulus that is generally lower than that of purely ceramic materials because the metallic A layers reduce the material's resistance to shear deformation. The bonding in MAX phases is hybrid in nature, involving strong covalent bonds between M and X atoms and weaker metallic bonds between M and A atoms. As a result, the shear modulus of these materials lies between the values typically observed for metals, which have lower moduli, and ceramics, which exhibit higher moduli. The composition of M2AX compounds significantly affects their shear modulus. For instance, substituting the M element with heavier transition metals such as chromium (Cr) or niobium (Nb) tends to increase the shear modulus due to the formation of stronger M-X bonds. Conversely, replacing the A element with a more ductile element such as silicon (Si) can reduce the shear modulus, reflecting the influence of the weaker metallic bonds in the structure. There are seventeen combinations that you must not include: M = Cr, A = S, X = N & M = Mo, A = Al, X = N & M = Mo, A = Ge, X = N & M = Mo, A = In, X = N & M = Mo, A = S, X = C & M = Mo, A = Si, X = N & M = Mo, A = Sn, X = N & M = V, A = S, X = N & M = W, A = Al, X = N & M = W, A = Ga, X = N & M = W, A = Ge, X = N & M = W, A = In, X = N & M = W, A = Pb, X = C & M = W, A = S, X = C & M = W, A = S, X = N & M = W, A = Si, X = N & M = W, A = Sn, X = N & M = Cr, A = In, X = N.
