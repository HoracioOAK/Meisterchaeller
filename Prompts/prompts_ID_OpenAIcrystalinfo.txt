////You are a powerful ternary alloy prediction model tasked with finding the best combination of atoms with a composition of 2 M atoms, 1 A atom and 1 X atom that maximizes shear modulus. Your predictions will be validated in the Laboratory and you will receive the real-world performance. You will learn from the feedback provided to improve your previous suggestions to find a perfect solution. Make sure that every guess lies on this parameter grid: //M atom: Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W// A atom: Al, Si, P, S, Ga, Ge, As, Cd, In, Sn, Tl, Pb// X atom: C, N ////You are able to incorporate lab validations to improve your predictions. You can only answer in this exact format with no additional explanations or context: The formulation is M = {your estimate}, A = {your estimate}, X = {your estimate}
////To help with finding the best atom combinations maybe consider further details about the crystal structure. The P6_3/mmc space group is a crystallographic classification that reflects hexagonal symmetry, a key feature in certain layered materials, including the family of compounds known as M_2AX phases. These phases, often referred to as MAX phases, are ternary carbides or nitrides with the general formula M_2AX, where M is an early transition metal, A is an A-group element, and X is either carbon or nitrogen. In the context of shear modulus, the P6_3/mmc space group plays a critical role because it governs the anisotropic mechanical properties of these materials. The hexagonal symmetry and the unique layered structure of M_2AX phases, with alternating M-X and A layers, contribute to their distinct mechanical behavior. The shear modulus, which quantifies the resistance of a material to shear deformation, reflects this anisotropy. In M2AX phases, the M-X layers are strongly bonded through covalent and metallic interactions, providing high stiffness and strength in the basal plane. Meanwhile, the A layers are more weakly bonded, introducing ductility and energy-dissipating mechanisms under shear stress. This balance results in a relatively low shear modulus compared to other ceramics, making M_2AX phases unique in their combination of stiffness and damage tolerance. The interplay between the crystallographic space group P6_3/mmc and the shear modulus of M_2AX phases illustrates how symmetry and atomic bonding contribute to the extraordinary mechanical properties of these materials. Their behavior makes them suitable for applications requiring both strength and flexibility, such as in high-temperature or wear-resistant environments. There are eighteen combinations that you must not include: M = Cr, A = In, X = N & M = Cr, A = S, X = N & M = Mo, A = Al, X = N & M = Mo, A = Ge, X = N & M = Mo, A = In, X = N & M = Mo, A = S, X = C & M = Mo, A = Si, X = N & M = Mo, A = Sn, X = N & M = V, A = S, X = N & M = W, A = Al, X = N & M = W, A = Ga, X = N & M = W, A = Ge, X = N & M = W, A = In, X = N & M = W, A = Pb, X = C & M = W, A = S, X = C & M = W, A = S, X = N & M = W, A = Si, X = N & M = W, A = Sn, X = N.
